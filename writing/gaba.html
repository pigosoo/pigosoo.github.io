    <h3>Role of GABA in Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
<br>

<p>As of recently, the public interest in mental health has been at an all time high. While many factors may have contributed to the development of this newfound interest in mental health, one has played an undeniably large role: the prevalence rates of mental disorders have been skyrocketing. In 2004, lifetime prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) in American adults was estimated to be 5.0%—this has climbed to a staggering 13% in less than a decade (Grant et al., 2005; Kessler, Petukhova, Sampson, Zaslavsky, & Wittchen, 2012). Moreover, SAD is currently estimated to affect nearly one in four adolescents aged 13 to 17, impairing function during a critical life period (Bendelow & Michaelis, 2015). Thus, it is imperative for scientists to gain a better understanding of the underlying neurochemical mechanisms implicated in SAD in order to better develop effective treatments for those affected. As the literature continues to grow, one change in neurochemistry has been consistently found in patients with social phobia—impaired functioning of the GABAergic system. Studies have shown that decreased GABAergic activity has been associated with anxiety symptoms (Möhler, 2012; Pollack, Jensen, Simon, Kaufman, & Renshaw, 2008) and that anxiolytics often work through up-regulation of the GABAergic pathway in the CNS (Evans et al., 2008; Pande et al., 2004; Pollack et al., 2008). Due to GABA’s primary function as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS and the fact that anxiety is often associated with heightened physiological arousal, it appears a logical conclusion that dysfunctions in the GABA system mediates anxiety symptoms in social anxiety disorder. </p>

<p>The hallmark feature of anxiety disorders is typically a constellation of physiological responses indicating activation of the sympathetic nervous system in absence of threatening stimuli. This is typically manifested through elevated blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and other behaviours indicative of sympathetic activation. As such, any neurotransmitter which may induce similar symptoms can have far-reaching implications in anxiety disorders. Not surprisingly, deficiencies in GABA activity has been linked to such symptoms. </p>

<p>Studies have shown that microinjection of GABAA receptor antagonists into various regions of the hypothalamus in mice causes socially avoidant behaviours and physiological responses typical of sympathetic activation (Shekar 1993; Shekhar, Hingtgen, & DiMicco, 1990; Shekhar & Katner, 1995). Furthermore, it has also been shown that decreased GABAA receptor density in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus is associated with increased anxious behaviour in mice, assessed through behavioural paradigms such as the elevated plus maze (Crestani et al., 1999; for a review see Möhler, 2006). Finally, social avoidance—perhaps the the most defining feature of SAD—has also been linked to dysfunctions in the GABAergic system. Research has detected increased sensitivity of 5-HT neurons to GABA in the dorsal raphe nucleus in mice models of SAD, resulting in decreased serotoninergic activity and socially avoidant behaviour (Challis et al., 2013). Furthermore, the same study found that inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus via optogenetic techniques disinhibited adjacent 5-HT neurons and erased previously seen socially avoidant behaviours (Challis et al., 2013). Ultimately, various lines research into the function of GABA system all seemingly converge onto a single finding: altered GABAergic activity in the CNS causes responses indicative of anxiety.</p>

<p>For effective treatment of social phobia, it is important that findings from animal models replicate in humans. However, as it is not feasible to induce SAD in human participants nor is it possible to genetically modify human embryos for research, experimental evidence in regards to SAD has largely come from clinical trials of pharmaceuticals; anxiolytics prescribed for social phobia often target various components of the GABA pathway, some of which include: benzodiazepines (enhances GABA channel activity), levetiracetam (enhances presynaptic fusion of GABA vesicles), pregablin (enhances GABA synthesis), and tiagbine (GABA reuptake antagonist)—all of which further suggests the importance of GABA in SAD (Baldwin et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2008; Pande et al., 2004; Pollack et al., 2008).</p>

<p>Although many forms of pharmacotherapy for social phobia alleviates symptoms through interactions with the GABAergic pathway, the recommended and often prescribed first-line treatment of SAD are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), suggesting that 5-HT may also be implicated in SAD (Baldwin et al., 2005; Hedges, Brown, Schwalk, Godfrey, & Manja Larcher, 2007). Indeed, studies have consistently shown that reduced 5-HT1A receptor binding is associated with symptoms of SAD in both animal and human models (for a review see Akimova, Lanzenberger, & Kasper, 2009). Genetic studies have also shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (SERT) gene is able to predict both the likelihood of developing social phobia as well as patient response to SSRI treatment (Greenberg et al., 2000; Kalueff, Fox, Gallagher, & Murphy, 2006; Mazzanti et al., 1998; Stein, Seedat, & Gelernter, 2006). Furthermore, amygdalar hypersensitivity—one of the best established neural basis of anxiety disorders—has also been found to be associated with polymorphisms in the SERT gene (Etkins & Wager, 2007; Furmark et al., 2004; Munafò, brown, & Hariri, 2008). These findings seem to propose that serotonin, in addition to GABA, may also play a large role in the pathogenesis of SAD.</p>

<p>Despite above evidence highlighting the importance of 5-HT, the effect of serotonin on SAD symptomology is often mediated by the GABAergic pathway, thus suggesting the importance of GABA over 5-HT in the pathogenesis of SAD. The serotonergic system in the CNS largely originates from a single structure in the midbrain: the raphe nucleus (Hornung, 2003). However, studies have found that serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus are extensively innervated by GABAergic neurons (Nitz & Siegel, 1997; Tao & Auerbach, 2002; Wang, Ochiai, & Nakai, 1992). Thus, 5-HT activity in the CNS is seemingly mediated by the GABA pathway; although the serotonergic pathway may produce symptomology typical of SAD, as evidenced by the effectiveness of SSRIs in treating social phobia, it appears that GABA is still the primary neurotransmitter responsible for the pathogenesis of social anxiety disorder.</p>

<p>Another neurotransmitter system which has been implicated in the etiology of SAD is the dopaminergic system. Studies have shown that in individuals with social phobia, D2 receptors in the striatum show a decreased binding affinity for dopamine (Schneier et al., 2009; Schneier et al., 2000). In accordance with this line of research, some researchers have characterized SAD as a disorder which arises due to misjudgment of risks and rewards associated with social interaction (Matthew, Coplan, & Gorman, 2011). However, while it is undeniable that the dopamine system is implicated in SAD, its effects are far less significant than that of the GABAergic and serotonergic pathways—evidenced by the fact that no medications prescribed for SAD targets the dopaminergic pathway in isolation. Anxiolytics which do affect the dopaminergic system—monoamine oxidase inhibitors—also simultaneously up-regulate the serotonergic system, and it is thus difficult to isolate the effect dopamine may have on the etiology of SAD (Taylor et al., 1982).</p>

<p>Ultimately, various lines of research into the neurochemical basis of social anxiety disorder suggests the importance of various neurotransmitter systems such as GABA, serotonin, and dopamine. Much like all other mental disorders, it is unreasonable and impossible to identify a single neurotransmitter as being solely responsible for the pathogenesis of SAD; however, large amounts evidence does suggest that the GABAergic system plays a large role in mediating the symptoms of SAD through its control of serotonergic system.</p>
