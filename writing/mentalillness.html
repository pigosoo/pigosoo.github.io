    <h3>The Reality of Mental Illness: A Case for the Medical Model of Psychiatric Disorders</h3>
<br>
<p>The topic of mental health has become the subject of great attention in recent years. While there may exist several reasons for the recent increase in awareness, one stands out amongst all: the impacts of mental illnesses has been devastating—the global disease burden of mental health has surpassed that of cancer and cardiovascular disease (Collins et al., 2011). However, while the suffering brought about by mental illnesses are not subject to controversy, a quieter debate has risen on the sidelines: is mental health a problem of medicine? Are mental illnesses truly diseases or only maladaptive behavior which has been unjustifiably medicalized?</p>

<p>One of the most influential critics of the medical model of mental illness, Thomas Szasz, famously proposed in his book, "The Myth of Mental Illness," that mental health is not a medical issue (Szasz, 1960). As Szasz claims, mental illnesses are not diseases, but rather “problems in living” (Szasz, 1960). Szasz proposes that diseases are malfunctions of biological mechanisms, evidenced by symptoms which are “referable to those of parts of the body [that are affected by the disease],“ whereas mental illnesses are “diseases of the mind”, which he argues is not “literally a ‘thing’—or physical object—and hence it can ‘exist’ in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist” (Szasz, 1960). Szasz’s critique of mental illness draws upon both cultural and biological arguments. Firstly, Szasz argues that a construct can only be considered a "disease" if it is a result of aberrant biological functioning, a criterion that mental illnesses are unable to fulfill. Additionally, while Szasz does not deny the distress suffered by patients with so-called “problems in living” (i.e., mental illnesses), he argues it is not of medical concern for although mental illnesses are “deviations from some clearly defined norm,” the norm is rooted in culture as opposed to science (Szasz, 1960). In essence, Szasz argues that mental illnesses are a subjective construct; those who are deemed mentally ill are those who exhibit behavior which is not in alignment with the social norms of the society in which the individual inhabits. </p>

<p>The questions raised regarding the medical validity of mental illnesses are not without merit. However, the present essay will demonstrate that the criteria set forth by Szasz for the definition of disease are far too restrictive, such that a host of bodily diseases are unable to fulfill its requirements. Furthermore, cultural critiques of mental disorders are addressed, and an attempt will be made to establish a universal model of mental illness that is uninfluenced by culture. Finally, issues regarding the usefulness of classification will be addressed.</p>

<h4>The Biological Basis of Mental Illness</h4>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><i>Biology is truly a land of unlimited possibilities. We may expect it to give us the most surprising information and we cannot guess what answers it will return in a few dozen years to the question we have put to it. They may be of a kind which will blow away the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses.</p></i>

<br>
<p>The reliability of mental health diagnoses has drawn immense criticism. Whereas bodily illnesses can often be diagnosed with perfect sensitivity and specificity, such as using a biopsy to determine the presence of cancers, mental illnesses have no such methods. Mental illnesses presently lack a component many consider to be essential to disease—biomarkers. Due to this shortcoming, the current model of diagnosis in psychiatry relies principally on a clinician’s judgment of whether psychological symptoms exhibited by a patient warrant a diagnosis of pathology. An obvious problem arises: Two physicians will reach the same diagnosis when given a patient’s lab results, but the same cannot be said for mental illnesses. Two psychiatrists may arrive at opposite conclusions when presented with the same patient—one may consider the patient to be in good health, whereas the other may consider the patient mentally ill. This is evidenced by the problematic inter-rater and test-retest reliability of certain psychiatric disorders, such as paranoid, histrionic, or narcissistic personality disorders (Zanarini, Frankenburg, Chauncey, & Gunderson, 1987). The result is not surprising, for when diagnosis is not informed by objective evidence (i.e., biomarkers) but rather the judgment of a clinician, subjectivity and bias are inescapable. Physicians may arrive at different conclusions when presented with the same patient, their interpretation and judgment colored by personal biases.</p>

<p>While it is undeniable that mental illnesses are lacking in biological validity compared to bodily illnesses, this deficit alone is insufficient grounds to deny psychiatry its place in medicine. For one, recent advances in neuroimaging has provided a wealth of evidence regarding neuroanatomical changes in mental illness; thus, it is unjustifiable to claim that no biological evidence exists (Videbech & Raunkilde, 2004; Wright et al., 2002). Furthermore, diagnoses reliant upon the clinical judgment of the physician is not isolated to psychiatry—similar methods can also be found in other medical fields such as neurology. The reason is simple. When the human body, filled with its infinite complexity, is not fully understood, it is impossible to present a complete biological explanation for all its malfunctions.</p>

<p>The diagnostic validity of mental disorders share issues with many neurological disorders. Despite this, criticisms have been almost exclusively aimed at psychiatry. Take for example Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is no doubt critics of psychiatry would accept its place in medicine without question. However, there exist striking similarities in the diagnosis of mental illnesses and AD which are left unaddressed. To begin, the diagnosis of AD if not informed by biomarkers; much like the diagnosis of mental illnesses, it is instead dependent upon a functional assessment of the patient in which memory, executive functioning, and behavioral issues are evaluated (McKhann et al., 2011). No definite biological evidence currently exist for AD which can lead to a conclusive diagnosis. In addition, the methods of assessment often involve questionnaires and self-reports, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, which test for deficits in executive function (Han, Cole, Bellavance, McCusker, & Primeau, 2000). Family or caregivers may also be interviewed to help inform diagnosis (Wolk & Dickerson, 2018). With the reliance upon questionnaires and interviews for diagnosis, subjectivity and bias find its way in the entirety of the AD diagnostic procedure. Again, much like mental illnesses, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s rests entirely upon a physician’s clinical judgment, aided by a variety of neuropsychiatric tests and interviews. A lack of concrete biomarker in both diseases permits diagnosis solely on the basis of functional deficits; however, the criticism levied at the diagnostic validity of mental illnesses are not shared by Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>The common defense for the medical validity of AD often cite the beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are found in AD patients as biomarkers evident of pathology. While this argument certainly has merit, it does not address the issue of diagnostic validity, for the biomarkers of AD can only be found in autopsy—the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s remains plagued by subjectivity. Moreover, other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease has no established biomarkers and are similarly diagnosed on functional deficits, but none has criticized the medical validity of Parkinson’s disease (Chou, 2018). The sheer complexity of the brain, in combination with our limited understanding of the nervous system, will no doubt give rise to diseases for which we lack full understanding of. However, in such cases, it has only been psychiatry where its validity as medical concepts are called into question. Perhaps one day technological advances will elucidate the functional pathways and biomarkers that will allow us to provide a complete biological picture for mental illnesses. The future appears promising, for not only has the amount of published articles in the field of biological psychiatry has been rapidly growing, studies have also shown promising potential for the use of fMRI in mental illnesses diagnoses, suggesting the existence of biomarkers (Drysdale et al., 2016; Singh & Rose, 2009). In the meantime, the absence of a biomarker does not render mental illness invalid as a medical construct, for this is a weakness shared by a whole host of other diseases. Just as bacterial infections were not less valid before Louis Pasteur's germ theory of disease, mental illnesses are not less valid because it has yet to find its Pasteur.</p>

<h4>Pathologizing Ordinary Behaviors</h4>

<br>

<p>With the introduction of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders arrives new controversy. The removal of bereavement as an exclusion criterion for major depression and the introduction of new disorders such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) have raised issues regarding whether psychiatry is medicalizing undesirable but normal behaviors. This is supported by evidence demonstrating that prevalence for nearly all psychiatric disorders is on the rise (Kessler et al., 2005). Additional concerns have also been raised regarding the case of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which has seen an eightfold increase in prevalence rate in the past three decades (Connor, 2011). The sudden increase in prevalence has raised justifiable concerns: is it possible that children naturally have low attention spans and an increased need for play? Is ADHD psychopathologizing ordinary behavior in children? The media appears to think so. A quick search in Google on using the keywords “ADHD” and “overdiagnosed” will draw articles titled “ADHD is Overdiagnosed, Here’s Proof” and “ADHD is Now Widely Overdiagnosed and for Multiple Reasons.” However, sensationalized headlines and opinion pieces do not lend substantial support to either side of the argument; the question remains, is there empirical evidence for the over-diagnosis of mental illnesses such as ADHD? The data on the subject remains mixed. On one hand, there exists experimental studies which have shown that clinicians have elevated rates of false positives in ADHD diagnosis (Brunchmüller, Margraf, & Schneider, 2012). On the other hand, studies of epidemiological data arrive at the opposite conclusion (Connor, 2011; Sciutto & Eisenberg, 2007). While evidence appear conflicted, the issue of increasing prevalence still needs to be addressed, for if any disease suddenly saw prevalence rates rise as rapidly as ADHD has had, questions will need to be answered.</p>

<p>When examining epidemiological data on ADHD, correlational inferences does not provide sufficient evidence for the over-diagnosis of ADHD—there are several other factors which may be responsible for this increase. To begin, the increased prevalence of disease has not been limited to ADHD or psychiatric disorders, similar increases have been observed in obesity (Aronne, 2001), diabetes (Mokdad et al., 2003), congestive heart failure (Ghali, Cooper, & Ford, 1990), hypertension (Whelton, 1994), Alzheimer’s disease (Reitz, Brayne, & Mayeux, 2011), and numerous other diseases (Burney, Chinn, & Rona, 1990; Johansson, Norrving, & Lindgren, 2000; Yeargin-Allsopp et al., 2003). Such increases in prevalence are argued by various authors to be indicative of increasingly more concrete and effective diagnostic criteria as well as being reflective of underlying changes in society as opposed to an issue of overdiagnosis (King & Bearman, 2009). Our increasingly sedentary lifestyle has lead to an obesity epidemic, which has subsequently lead to increases in heart disease and diabetes (Martínez-González, Martinez, Hu, Gibney, & Kearney, 1999); our medical advances allows us longer life expectancies, leading to higher incidence of Alzheimer’s disease as the onset is typically only during old age (Wolk & Dickerson, 2018). The speed at which our society is advancing poses unprecedented pressures upon all, and the effects remain unknown. In an environment which is overloaded with stimuli and information, it appears reasonable to claim that the attention span of children would suffer to accommodate the vast amount of readily available information. Thus, the rapid rise of new ADHD cases may be largely a result of advances in psychiatry and society and not a result of overdiagnosis. Finally, although psychiatry is not a novel concept, only recently has it moved away from the psychoanalytical traditions and embraced the empirical nature of the scientific method, evidenced by the creation of the DSM in 1952 and the inclusion of mental disorders in sixth edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-6) in 1949 (Grob, 1991; Katschnig, 2010). Whereas other branches of the medical sciences have had centuries of time to empirically validate its concepts, modern psychiatry has had no such convenience due to its young age. New concepts are still being proposed, classification criterion solidified, and evidence for mental disorders being discovered which would no doubt increase the prevalence rates of mental disorders. Epidemiological evidence from autism spectrum disorders (ASD) support this conclusion, for studies have shown that changes in diagnostic criteria are correlated with increases in new cases of ASD (King & Bearman, 2009). The authors suggest the increase in ASD diagnosis is largely due to reclassification—patients previously diagnosed with mental retardation are now receiving diagnoses of ASD; the same may be applicable to other mental disorders. As our conceptualizations of mental illnesses become further solidified by a wealth of empirical evidence, the criteria for diagnosis are bound to evolve, leading to the reclassification of previously known diseases. In addition, unrecognized pathologies may come to be recognized. A parallel, once again, can be found in physical illnesses, for whenever a new concept of bodily disease is conceived, such as diabetes, there is bound to be a sudden increase in the amount of novel cases, as those previously living with the disease come to recognize that their condition is pathological. Similarly, with the recent explosion in mental health awareness, it is no doubt that more people have come to recognize their suffering as abnormal and thus seek treatment.</p>

<p>The willingness to change and adapt to empirical findings is evidence of good scientific practice, and such cases are routinely found in psychiatry, which are best evidenced by the continual updates to the DSM. While in its infancy, there is no doubt that psychiatry will encounter many mistakes in psychopathologizing ordinary behavior—some of which may include DMDD or PMDD. But, mistakes are indicative of progress. In the meantime, it is unjustifiable to hold psychiatry to the same standard as other branches of modern medicine, for psychiatry cannot accomplish in half a century what others have accomplished since Hippocrates. The various conceptualizations of disorders in psychiatry must be given time to develop and find their grounding in empirical research. Judging from the pace at which our understanding of mental illnesses have evolved, psychiatry will no doubt one day find itself firmly within medicine.</p>

<h4>Cultural Influences and Towards a Universal Conceptualization of Mental Illness</h4>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><i>To argue according to rigorous rational criteria is to guarantee that the results attained are universally valid.</i></p>
<div align="right" style="margin-right:10%;"><i>

</div></i>
<br>

<p>In addition to the lack of concrete diagnostic procedures and potential issues of overdiagnosis, psychiatry and mental illness has often been criticized from a cultural perspective. Such comments and criticisms range from the extreme, arguing mental illnesses are entirely a product of culture and exist as a method to classify socially deviant behavior, to more moderate positions, which argue that society differs in its approach to mental illness, resulting in differences in the course of illness and patient outcomes (Bhugra, 2006; Shorter, 2013; Szasz, 1960; Wurtzberg & Rocchio, 2014). Although not all cultural critiques of mental illness question the validity of mental illness as a medical concept, the root concern remains same: bodily illnesses are largely unaffected by culture, the outcome and diagnosis of pneumonia do not vary as a function of culture; psychiatric disorders are not the same, its diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes are all subject to cultural influences and thus, mental illnesses are different from traditional bodily illnesses.</p>

<p>The critique of mental illnesses through a cultural lens may be the most substantial of all criticisms, for it is undeniable that definitions of mental illness vary significantly as a function of culture, the history of psychiatry bearing its witness. In the 19th century, Samuel Cartwright conceived of drapetomania as a mental illness, the suffers of which are black slaves whom had “an unconscionable desire to abscond from his or her owner” (Bynum, 2000). In addition, women who displayed behaviours unaligned with society were deemed “hysteric,” with the most well known case being the Salem witch trials, in which women were executed for behaviors thought to be associated with the devil (Tasca, Rapetti, Carta, & Fadda, 2012). The history of psychiatry, much like all other branches of medicine, has had a dark past influenced by culture norms; however, unique to psychiatry is the exceedingly large role played by culture in conceptualizations of mental illness. The issue regarding culture and mental illness thus becomes apparent: does there exist a theory of mental illness which is free from the influences of culture?</p>

<p>There are no clear answers. But, some resolution may be found through addressing the extremes of the cultural critique, such as those by Thomas Szasz’s, which suggests that all mental disorders are behaviours which society has deemed socially deviant (Szasz, 1960). Szasz often cites drapetomania in his writings as an exemplar for his argument, demonstrating the faults of psychiatry and its susceptibility to cultural norms—behaviours negatively valued by society are deemed pathological, culturally normative behaviours are viewed as opposite. Although this may have held true across much of psychiatry’s history, Szasz fails to recognize that there exists a degree of medical universality—illnesses, both bodily and mental, are pathological independent of cultural influences. This can be best demonstrated in the form of a thought experiment. Consider for a second the existence of a hypothetical planet “Marlboro.” Due to the prevalence of volcanoes on Marlboro, the planet, although habitable to humans, contains an atmosphere that has been filled by poisonous smog such that the life expectancy of its inhabitants rarely surpass twenty due to complications from conditions of the lung. On this planet, it is culturally normative to die of lung cancer at age twenty. Does it follow that lung cancer should not be classified as pathological? The conclusion to our thought experiment becomes apparent: the classification of illness and cultural normativity are not mutually exclusive concepts. A construct can be considered an illness despite its cultural normativity. The ideal human body, one that is free from all pathologies, is considered to be a universal health standard for which deviation from it constitutes a diseased state.</p>

<p>As we have established that illnesses are uninfluenced by culture, the issue of its applicability to mental disorders, as opposed to bodily illnesses, arises. Is there a universal psychological state from which deviation constitutes a mental illness? Or, perhaps more concerning, with the complexity of the human mind taken into consideration, can there exist a universal psychological state? Some evidence from the studies of emotion seem to suggest so. Ekman et al. (1971) has found support for the existence of six emotions which can be recognized cross-culturally: happiness, surprise, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger. Although some studies have shown that the basic human emotions were not as basic as Ekman originally thought (i.e., still subject to culture influences), replication studies and meta-analyses nevertheless lend support to the existence of basic human emotions that transcend cultural boundaries (Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002). However, the problem is not resolved: to deviate from sadness is to feel happiness, surprise to preparedness, fear to courage, disgust to delight, anger to calm. It appears absurd to classify happiness, preparedness, readiness, courage, delight, and calmness as pathological. So, what should we do?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we must briefly reflect back upon planet Marlboro. The universal standard from which all citizens of Marlboro deviates is one of physical well-being; Szasz’s definition of illness is decidedly applicable here: the standard of health is one that is free from “structural or functional alteration of cells, tissues and organs.” In summary, the health standard from which deviation constitutes disease must 1) be universally applicable to all humans and 2) indicative of good well-being; thus, the question then becomes: does there exist an equivalent psychological state that is universal and indicative of good health? If such state can be found, then it can be logically deduced that deviation from this state would constitute disease and the construct of mental illness can be validated.</p>

<p>Research regarding psychological well-being falls under the domain of positive psychology, where evidence has emerged for a variety of factors which contribute to feelings of subjective psychological wellness, such as autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). Despite the variety of factors which seem to contribute to psychological health, all seem to converge upon a unifying supralevel factor: happiness. This appears a logical conclusion. To assess the psychological health and well-being of an individual, a sensible and obvious question should be: “are you happy?” It would not seem strange to conclude that a man who is happy should be considered psychologically healthy and one who is unhappy to be considered psychologically unhealthy. This view is validated through empirical evidence, in which happiness has been found as a robust correlate to nearly all measurements of well-being, such as autonomy (Diener, 1984; Diener, 2000). In sum, happiness is largely viewed as interchangeable with subjective well-being in positive psychology (Hills & Argyle, 2002)</p>

<p>We have arrived at two premises to aid our conceptualization of mental illnesses. We have established universally normative psychological states in the form of basic emotions, one of which being happiness. Secondly, we have determined that happiness is essential to psychological well-being. The argument then follows that deviation from happiness should constitute a form of mental illness. This conclusion however, does not come without problems. What does deviation from happiness look like? Does a lack of happiness constitute a mental disorder? Or should it be the case of excessive sorrow?</p>

<p>To address our question, we must briefly step back from the realm of emotion science and consider happiness from a different perspective. Are there psychological states which are incompatible with happiness? A possible candidate could be suffering. Although stoic philosophy often emphasizes the importance of virtue and sacrifice to attain happiness, to the modern man who has no interest in philosophy, suffering appears antithetical to happiness. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a situation in which suffering brings happiness to the individual. While some may happily suffer to obtain some external reward—for example, working long hours for excellent pay; if given the choice, no doubt in majority of cases the individual would choose to work less for the same pay. There exists no intrinsic happiness in suffering. Thus, as suffering appears to be mutually exclusive with happiness, it can be logical to conclude that for a deviation from happiness to be considered pathological, the individual must undergo some degree of suffering. This definition helps us resolve the issue of a neutral affect—there is no distress involved in feeling neither happiness nor sorrow and hence it should not be considered a psychiatric disorder.</p>

<p>This classification however does not escape the influence of culture, for although happiness is a universal concept, the way by which individuals pursue it manifests itself in different ways cross-culturally. Some may find happiness in power, some may find it in wealth, some in family, in friendship, in health, in love, and in countless other ways. And thus we’ve arrived at the role of culture in psychiatry—it best serves as an adjunct to psychiatry, and does not necessarily play a role in its foundation, for we have derived a set of criterions for a conceptualization of mental illness in which culture plays no role. However, mental illnesses may present themselves in different forms cross-culturally as various ways of suffering. Thus, the role of culture in psychiatry is not to guide the classification and definition of mental disorders, but rather to inform treatment by relieving the patient of suffering in a manner that is culturally appropriate.</p>

<h4>The Utility of Classification</h4>

</div></i>
<br>

<p>The debate regarding the place of psychiatry in medicine has largely overlooked an important question: what is the usefulness of classification? Many proponents and opponents of psychiatry have been fixated on how mental illness is classified, but fails to consider why it should or should not be classified as a medical issue. Furthermore, why are certain conditions considered pathological when others are not?</p>

<p>The position of Thomas Szasz regarding the classification of disease is clear: a disease represents aberrant biological processes: “structural or functional alteration of cells, tissues and organs” (Szasz, 1960). However, is the classification of disease really to capture errors in biology? Is there an additional criterion for classification that critics of psychiatry are missing?</p>

<p>As discussed previously, perhaps suffering should be considered a necessary criterion for the classification of disease, the reason being that biological abnormalities which cause no distress are not classified as diseases. Human vestigial organs such as the Darwin’s tubercle (a swelling of ear that is found in other mammals but have uncertain function), vomeronsal organ (pheromone detection), and the plica semilunaris (vestigial remnant of a third eyelid) are all cases of biological mutation: we can no longer detect pheromones, our eyes are not as well protected as before, and countless other functions have been lost as a result of evolution in which the only evidence which remains for their existence is the presence of such vestigial traits (Loh & Cohen, 2016; Owens, 1866; Stensaas, Lavker, Monti-Bloch, Grosser, & Berliner, 1991). These mutations, during the course of their evolution, are all cases of aberrant biological processes; however, none are considered pathological for the reason that they cause no suffering to the individual. Humans lacking the ability to detect pheromones does not influence our daily lives for we no longer have use for pheromone detection.</p>

<p>The core criterion for the classification of a constellation of symptoms as being a “diseased state” is thus apparent; it is unrelated to a malfunctioning of biological mechanisms (although this is most often the case) but rather based on the distress the patient must suffer as a result of the symptoms. If distress is the main criterion for a cluster of symptoms to be classified as a disease, then it becomes blindingly apparent that mental illnesses should be considered a disease. In addition to our previous established conceptualization of mental illness, for which distress is a core component, mental health also causes distress in greater severity compared to bodily illnesses—evidenced by the high suicide rates of those suffering from mental disorders. A meta-analysis by Harris and Barraclough (1997) found that all mental illnesses—excepting mental retardation and dementia—significantly increase suicidality.</p>

<p>The desire for life is a primitive instinct, engrained within all by the hands of nature. From the single-celled prokaryote to humans, no organism willingly opts to end its own existence barring disastrous circumstances. However, in those suffering from afflictions of the mind, the choice to pursue death is not uncommon. For the suffering becomes so great that the primal urge to survive becomes temporarily suppressed and death welcomed as a preferable alternative. In medicine, a field wholly concerned with the well-being of the patient, there can be no worse outcome than the cessation of life; thus, to consider a condition which drives those affected to suicide not a problem of medicine is antithetical to the very principles of medicine.</p>

<br>


<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><i>The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.</i></p>
