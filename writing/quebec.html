    <h3>Quebec and Canada: A Tale of Two Nations</h3>
<br>


<p>The place of Quebec in Canadian politics has been the subject of contentious debate since the inception of Canada by the British North America Act of 1867. This paper will seek to demonstrate that Pierre Trudeau’s Pan-Canadian view of Canada is fundamentally flawed and incompatible with Quebec regionalism. As a consequence, Quebec and English Canada can never be truly united. The incompatibility of Quebec nationalism with Trudeau’s vision of Canada manifests itself in three main ways. Firstly, Quebec sees itself as a distinct nation from all other provinces of Canada, and actively attempts to reject English influence within its borders. Secondly, the failure of Trudeau’s bilingual policies despite substantial effort by the federal government demonstrates that the English and French in Canada live in different nations, separated not by sovereignty but by culture. Lastly, a situation has arisen in Quebec in which nationalist and separatist sentiments work in conjunction against the Pan-Canadian view of Canada in a paradoxical manner, with both being unable to be concurrently satisfied.</p>

<h4>Anglophones in Quebec: An Unwanted Linguistic Minority</h4>
<p>The most defining feature of Quebec regionalism is preservation of French culture, or more specifically, the French language. With the enactment of the Charter of the French Language in 1977, colloquially known as Bill 101, it became strikingly apparent that the way in which French language was to be preserved in Quebec will be achieved not through the strengthening of language education, but rather limiting the use of English. As Reed Scowen, Anglophone and former member of the Quebec National Assembly, writes in his book, Bill 101 was to be “the entire foundation … on which the Quebec nation-state was to be constructed.” With the victory of the Parti Quebecois in 1976 and subsequently enactment of Bill 101 one year later, Quebec was determined to build a nation-state, and the English was not welcome.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous example of Quebec’s desire to eliminate English influence in Quebec was in the sections of Bill 101 relating to primary and secondary education—sections 72 and 73. Although both sections has been struck down by supreme court decisions after the patriation of the Charter, it is the intent of these clauses that reveals Quebec’s legislative agenda towards the Anglophone population. Sections 72 and 73 explicitly outlines citizens of Quebec who are able to receive elementary and secondary schooling in English: children whose parents have received English schooling in Quebec or outside of Quebec but has lived in Quebec since 1977, those who are already receiving instruction in English in Quebec, and the siblings of aforementioned children. Simply put, those families having access to English schools in Quebec has become a group in which no new members can join, and existing members may only leave. Thus, the growth of the English-speaking population was restricted as English education became unavailable—as these families leave Quebec, so will the English language with them. With the growth of the Anglophone population confined, Bill 101 then worked to remove traces of English from aspects of everyday life in Quebec.</p>

<p>The systematic exclusion of English elements from the public sphere in Quebec first came in the form of sections 58 and 141, both addressing the use of French in public. Section 58 stated that all public signs must be written in French only, while section 141 required the usage of French in all private sector companies. This required companies to have documents, records, internal communications, computer systems, and nearly all aspects of business to be in French. Over a few years, the public face of Quebec, from restaurant menus to public advertisements, have changed from a mixture of English and French to one that was almost entirely French. It was obvious as to why this section was included—the dominance of French in the public sphere of Quebec gave credence to the idea that Quebec, as a region, was distinct from the rest of Canada. However, this came at a cost to Anglophones living in the province, with many sharing the sentiment that they feel unwelcomed in Quebec. Despite this, little has changed in the following years due to the popular support of Bill 101 from the Quebec electorate, and those changes that did occur usually came as a result of supreme court rulings. As Ron Graham says, “for twenty years it was a truism of Quebec politics: don’t touch Bill 101.”</p>

<p>Aside from Bill 101 and the private sector, the provincial government also attempted to eliminate representation of Anglophones in the public sector. For a population to voice its concerns, it is imperative that they receive sufficient representation within public service, and such is not the case with Anglophones in Quebec. The 2011 Canadian Census showed that 7.7% of people living in Quebec are considered Anglophones, while only being 0.9% of Quebec’s public service. Statistics have also shown that in recent years, more Anglophones than Francophones are bilingual in Quebec, and if preferential hiring of bilingual public servants were the case as it is in the rest of Canada, there would be an increased representation of Anglophones in Quebec public service. The only explanation for the systematic underrepresentation of Anglophones in Quebec public service is that preferential hiring is given to those who are French, rather than those who are bilingual, contrary to policies in every other province of Canada. The systematic exclusion of Anglophones from public service is no doubt a further attempt to eliminate traces of English culture present within the province, and further lends credence to the notion that Quebec simply does not want to become a part of Canada.</p>

<p>The impacts of Bill 101 and other practices marginalizing the Anglophone population in Quebec are apparent. Between the years of 1971 and 2001, a net total of 276,000 people whose mother tongue is English left Quebec for another province, and those who remain cluster around urban regions such as Montreal. Hence, it can be seen that not only does Quebec reject English influence, it actively tries to eliminate it, and with such regional sentiments, it’s difficult to imagine a Quebec that could one day be fully integrated into Canada.</p>

<h4>The Alleged Success of Trudeau’s Bilingualism</h4>

<p>Bill 101 has shown that Quebec does not see themselves as a part of Pierre Trudeau’s unified Canada. However, some believe that Trudeau’s bilingualism policies achieved its intended purposes of unifying Canada, cemented in the Official Languages Act of 1969, formally recognizing both English and French as the official languages of Canada. The present paper proposes that the so-called success of bilingualism is merely symbolic in nature; in practice, Canada has not successfully become a bilingual state, but instead two distinct unilingual states.</p>

<p>The argument for the success of bilingualism typically arrives in two parts: first, proponents cite the simple fact that Quebec has not separated as indicative of the success of bilingualism. Secondly, if anyone wishes to become a high ranking public servant in Canada, they must, by convention, be fluent in both languages; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has recently stated publicy that any judge wishing to be nominated to the Supreme Court of Canada must be functionally bilingual, and the nomination of Malcolm Rowe demonstrates that the promise has been held. These arguments does hold merit to some degree—public opinion polls show the majority of Canadians support and recognizes the importance of bilingualism in Canada, and it is also true that bilingualism in the public sector has increased over the years.</p>

<p>The success of bilingualism in the public sector, however, fails to translate to rest of the country, and statistics provided by the 2011 Canadian Census paints a dreary future for bilingualism in Canada. To begin, geographical lines for language has become increasingly apparent. Whereas Pierre Trudeau’s policies strengthened bilingualism in areas with already high rates of bilingualism, it did little to influence primarily Anglophone areas outside of central Canada. In essence, it failed to promote bilingualism where its mostly needed and thus will have little long-term impact in the growth of French. The 2011 Canadian Census revealed that 80% of those who are bilingual lived in Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick, while not a single western province had a bilingual rate of over 10%. It is evident that bilingualism is not a Canadian phenomenon. Rather, it is an anomaly isolated to select regions only. What is perhaps more indicative of the formation of two unilingual states is that the rate of bilingualism in Quebec has been dropping amongst Francophones—an increasingly large amount of native French speakers no longer speak English to the extent that more Anglophones in Quebec are bilingual compared to Francophones. In fact, the further one walks away from the Quebec border, the more rapid the decline of bilingualism. National trends across Canada paint a similar picture, with the rate of bilingualism dropping for the first time since 1961, from 17.7% in 2001 to 17.5% in 2011.</p>

<p>While there has been success in bilingualism in the public service, its success is not seen in the everyday life of Canadians. The rates of bilingualism are declining across all Canadian provinces except Quebec, with especially high rates of decline amongst teenagers and young adults. Those who are bilingual outside of Quebec also tend not to retain their proficiency in both languages as they age. The current trends seem to suggest that, in the future, those who are able to speak French would become increasingly concentrated within Quebec, while those who are bilingual outside of Quebec would, over time, lose their proficiency in French, creating a geographical divide, and consequently, two unilingual nations within Canada as opposed to a unitary bilingual state.</p>

<h4>The Future of Quebec Nationalism and Separatism</h4>

<p>The history of the Quebecois opinion on independence has been highly divide; the independence referendum of 1995 failed by a margin of less than 1% with a voter turnout of 93.52%. Closer inspection of the referendum results show that feelings of independence are clearly divided along language lines. Anglophones (whose mother tongue is English), and allophones (whose mother tongue is neither English nor French), voted against the referendum with a 95% margin.  What’s perhaps more revealing of provincial sentiments on independence is the fact the majority of ridings in Quebec, specifically 80 out of 125, supported the referendum. Had the criteria for the referendum not be based on popular vote but rather number of districts won, Quebec would be a separate nation today. The sole reasons for Quebec’s membership in Canada are that the criteria for independence has unintentionally favoured the “no” side, and the fact that English immigrants in Quebec voted overwhelming against separation. However, the 1995 referendum may be the last of its kind—demographics and public opinion have shifted rapidly away from Quebec separatists as polls have consistently shown that the majority of Quebec would vote no for a hypothetical referendum on separation, most notably amongst young voters by nearly a 40% margin. If current trends are to hold, one should presumably expect the Quebec separatist movement to be a relic of the past in future years.</p>

<p>However, it should be made clear that the complete demise of the Quebec separation movement—if it were ever to happen, would have very little, if any, effect on the future of Quebec nationalism. Separatism and nationalism in Quebec are two entities that are intertwined and distinct at the same time, and the recent decline of separatist sentiments in Quebec came at a direct result of satisfied nationalist feelings. While Quebec still considers itself to be distinct from Canada, it has received sufficient concessions from English Canada that it feels separation is no longer required or beneficial, evidenced by the 2009 Angus Reid poll which showed that 82% of Quebecois still feels Quebec is distinct from the rest of Canada despite declining separatist sentiments. The Quebec National Assembly is also the only legislature in North America with a French speaking majority as well as being the only province in Canada using the civil law as opposed to the common law. From this perspective, Quebec certainly does appear like a distinct nation. Perhaps the majority of Quebec now feels as if they are treated justly, albeit strictly in the Quebecois interpretation of “just,” that the desire to separate has been temporarily subdued. Unfortunately, for the federal Canadian government, the Quebec situation has become a seesaw. In order to placate separatists, sufficient autonomy must be given to the region, helping ensure the distinctiveness of Quebec from English Canada. If the federal government attempts to integrate Quebec by means of taking power away from the National Assembly, then separatist feelings are sure to reignite. Perhaps it is due to the impossibility of the situation that recent prime ministers of Canada has seemingly given up on Pierre Trudeau’s original Pan-Canadian view of Canada, with both Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau both publicly recognizing Quebec as a distinct nation.</p>
